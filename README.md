## Motivation

When I started preparing for my first milestone project, I wanted to choose an individual or organisation that would benefit greatly from having a website or online presence. My first project idea was about my local football club which I would have enjoyed creating and designing. However, my football club already has a functioning website and so, I decided to turn my attention elsewhere.

I decided on designing a website for an individual who is a professional fitness instructor and swimming teacher. Iain Hurton is a long-time family friend who found a passion for health and fitness after finishing secondary school. Iain is now a fully qualified fitness instructor, personal trainer, swimming teacher and lifeguard. In recent years, I have been amazed and inspired by Iain’s work ethic and willingness to grow his fitness brand. Although I have not yet taken part, I have witnessed his group fitness classes in which he is very friendly, motivating and encouraging. Iain has shown his ability to adapt to unexpected situations. In recent months, Iain was forced to pivot to online classes while lockdown measures prevent groups from forming in large numbers and put a halt to swimming classes for the foreseeable future.

I chose to create a website specifically for Iain after following his progress for a number of years. It was clear that he would gain some benefit from having an online presence other than social media platforms. Iain has already generated a strong following on social media platforms particularly Instagram and Facebook. He has gained a promising client base with men and women ranging from teenagers to retired people. For this reason, I thought he would greatly benefit from having a website which could be accessed by existing clients, potential clients and others wanting to learn more about Iain Hurton's lifestyle and his overall approach to fitness.

## Challenges

One challenge I experienced when creating this website was meeting up with others in the hope of getting their valuable opinions and feedback on my progress. One solution to this was to schedule a video call on Microsoft Teams with my friends and colleagues. I was able to share my screen, navigate throughout the website and show off some features while describing my actions. As part of my testing process, I have shared my progress with family members, friends and colleagues. This process was beneficial and highly valuable for user experience, asking questions and implementing feedback. This was very helpful in the designing and structuring of my website.

Another setback I had was scheduling my first mentoring session. I scheduled the session for a Wednesday evening but lost track of time and ended up missing the appointment. This was completely my fault and so I could not reschedule for a future date. I was determined to invest sufficient time and effort into this project to achieve a desirable grade but more importantly to reach the goal I set out with. That goal was to design a static front-end website which I can look back on with pride. I experienced frustration at times during this project but ultimately, I learned a vast amount about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap through making mistakes and correcting them.

## Design

**Colour Scheme**  #

Insert hex codes for colours here

**Typography**

-   The 'Fjalla One', sans-serif font is the primary font used throughout the website. From the Google Fonts website: Fjalla One is a medium contrast display sans serif. Fjalla One has been carefully adjusted to the restrictions of the screen. Despite having display characteristics Fjalla One can be used in a wide range of sizes.
    
-   'Big Shoulders Stencil Display', cursive is the font used for H1 Headings throughout the website. From the Google Fonts website: Big Shoulders is a superfamily of condensed American Gothic typefaces, created for the Chicago Design System, as well as the citizens of Chicago. The family's tall, sans-serif forms are based in Chicago's multiple histories in railway transport, public political action, and dance.
    
-   Big Shoulders, the primary family, is used in the Chicago Design System as the primary typeface to identify Chicago and its citizens. Big Shoulders allows Chicagoans to speak with one consistent typographic voice. Big Shoulders Stencil explores Chicago’s histories in work and protest, and is designed to apply the Chicagoan voice to those uses. I like the font at first glance and I loved discovering its roots in Chicago as we share that connection.
    

**Imagery**

-   Imagery is important. The large, full-width background images on each page were chosen to be striking, vibrant and to grab the user's attention right away. The website has a modern, vigorous and vibrant appeal and will peak the interest of the user at first sight.

## Wireframes

I used the website wireframe.cc to create blueprints for my website. I also sketched some wireframes and blueprints by hand. I created wireframes for all pages on the websites. All wireframes and mockups can be found in the folder assets/documentation.

When I started work on my first milestone project, i wanted to choose a project that would benefit from having a website or an online presence. My first project idea was about my local football club which I would have enjoyed designing. However, my football club already has a functioning website.

Therefore, I turned my attention to designing a website for a long-term family friend. Iain is a friend who found a passion for health and fitness after finishing secondary school. Iain is now a fully qualified fitness instructor and swimming teacher. In recent years, I have been amazed and inspired by Iain’s work ethic and willingness to grow his fitness brand. Although I have not yet taken part, I have witnessed his group fitness classes in which he is very friendly, motivating and encouraging. Iain has shown his ability to adapt to unexpected challenges. More recently, having set up online zoom classes.

I chose to create a website specific for Iain after following his progress for a number of years. It was clear that he would gain some benefit from having an online presence. Iain has already generated a strong following on social media platforms particularly Instagram and Facebook. He has gained a promising client base with men and women ranging from teenagers to retired people. For this reason, I thought he would benefit from having a webpage which could be accessed by existing clients, potential clients and others.
